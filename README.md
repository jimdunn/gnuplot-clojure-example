# gnuplot-clojure-example

Simple examples of using [gnuplot](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/) from Clojure to 
plot "real time" data. Uses the `gnuplot` frontend [feedgnuplot](https://github.com/dkogan/feedgnuplot). 
See the very nice documentation for `gnuplot` and `feedgnuplot` for explanations of the
commands or to learn to make fancier plots.

## Usage

Run the examples with

    $ lein run

Make sure you have `gnuplot` and `feedgnuplot` installed.
